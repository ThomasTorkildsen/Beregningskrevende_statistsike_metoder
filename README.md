A good report!

Even though it is an exercise sheet and you are answering questions, we want it written as a report. This means explaining the task and detailing how you are solving it with text as well as including the necessary math.

Figure text, figure references and equation references are something I also want you guys to include for the next report.

Overall good answers, but I am missing some detailed answers.

Overall very good report. Detailed introduction to the report itself and the individual exercises and detailed math and presentation of results. 

I think the presented runtimes of the blocked MCMC simulations are a little strange and some are wrong. 

In the control.inla I would have like to see a specific input for strategy in 2b as the default strategy is simplified laplace and the default integration strategy is 'auto' so it might default to CCD as you specified in 2a. Look at       ?control.inla output.

The figures can be improved some. I would recommend saving the figures to .png or .pdf and use latex code to show them in the report . Don't have titles as you have the same information in the figure text. This does not affect to grade, but can influence overall.

Comp 3: Score 9/10

Good work. THe language is sometimes not very clear, especially in the first part of the exercise. I part B there is a misunderstanding of how the model is parametrized in the lm() function. All in all a good work
